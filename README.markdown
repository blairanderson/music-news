#Music Blog Submission(and music player) App.

##Summary
I have a music blog, and i was tired of receiving emails from bands and DJs in all random styles so i created this repo. You should be able to begin accepting music from bands with very little work.
Currently it only supports Soundcloud. I'd like to extend to youtube and bandcamp as well but the player only works with soundcloud.


##Goals
[ ] It should be super easy to add a song to a list

[ ] Should be super easy to listen to music

[ ] Songs should be taggable

[ ] Should have playlists for latest/greatest/favorites

[ ] Should be able to view playlists for specific tags

[ ] should be able to create a blog post very simply from viewing any view

[ ] should be able to view an "artists" page with a bunch of their music available.

[ ] artist page should include youtube/bandcamp if available.
